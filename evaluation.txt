Following is the role and ratings for the three group members:

Mrinal Kumar:

Mrinal implemented the greedy heuristic algorithm. He tried various strategies for it and could implement final with good accuracy.
He also tried genetic algorithm, but that couldn't be completed so we had to go for the fall back.

Report:
Mrinal worked on Introduction, related work, greedy algorithm write up and on formatting.

Rating:10/10


Yang Song:

Yang implemented Simulated Annealing and MST approx. He tried certain variants of SA and the final accuracy of SA was pretty good.

Report:
Yang wrote the part of Simulated annealing, hill climbing and MST approximation.

Rating:10/10
